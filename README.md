# Summary

I’m a dedicated researcher pursuing my MS Thesis in Crafting Adversarial
Patches for Aerial Imagery. I have a strong interest in practical
adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. My expertise spans Computer
Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Time Series Analysis. Eager to
broaden my horizons, I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position to advance
my research and help make the world a better place.

    | **Sentiment classification over financial text** |     |

    <div class="justify" markdown="1">

    -   Classified the news corpus with manually annotated class labels
        into "Positive" or "Negative" or "Neutral".

    -   Implemented various machine learning classifiers like Support
        Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression,
        and Decision Tree using Bag of Words on extracted features of
        the data.

    -   Implemented Deep learning techniques (stacked LSTM, RNN, FFNN
        and Transformer) to perform the same task.
